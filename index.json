ATTENDANCE OBJECTIVES Event participation focused on 4 core objectives to enhance technical capabilities and strategic thinking:\nGenAI Security: Understanding security mechanisms in GenAI and AI Agents to ensure enterprise data safety. Development Process (AI-DLC): Exploring the AI-Driven Development Lifecycle model and how to integrate it into current DevOps processes. Data Platform: Methods for building a Unified Data Platform optimized for Analytics and AI. Trend Updates: Grasping strategies, vision, and latest GenAI technologies on AWS. 2. SPEAKER LIST (AWS EXPERTS) The event brought together top experts from Amazon Web Services:\nJun Kai Loke – AI/ML Specialist SA Kien Nguyen – Solutions Architect Tamelly Lim – Storage Specialist SA Binh Tran – Senior Solutions Architect Taiki Dang – Solutions Architect Michael Armentano – Principal WW GTM Specialist 3. TECHNICAL CONTENT HIGHLIGHTS 3.1. Unified Data Platform Data is the core foundation (\u0026ldquo;Data is the fuel\u0026rdquo;) for successful AI deployment.\nEnd-to-End Architecture: Complete workflow from Ingestion $\\rightarrow$ Storage $\\rightarrow$ Processing $\\rightarrow$ Access $\\rightarrow$ Governance. Objective: Eliminate \u0026ldquo;Silos\u0026rdquo; (isolation) in data, people, and processes. Moving towards Self-service and standardized Governance. Key AWS Services: S3, Glue, Redshift, Lake Formation, OpenSearch, Kinesis/MSK. Featured Technology: Zero-ETL integration (connecting S3 $\\leftrightarrow$ Redshift, Aurora, DynamoDB\u0026hellip;) helps minimize latency and complexity in data transfer. 3.2. GenAI Strategy \u0026amp; Tools on AWS Amazon Bedrock: Primary service allowing Foundation Models (FM) selection, RAG integration, Guardrails, optimization between cost and latency. Amazon SageMaker Unified Studio: Unified platform for Data, Analytics \u0026amp; AI. Comprehensive MLOps support (Pipelines, Registry, Deployment, Monitoring). AI Agents - Productivity Enhancement: Transition from single Assistant to Multi-agent systems (like AgentCore, Amazon Nova). Supporting frameworks: CrewAI, LangGraph, LlamaIndex. Real-world Applications: Customer service (CS), Business Intelligence (BI) with Amazon Q (in QuickSight), business process automation. 3.3. GenAI Security \u0026amp; Trust Multi-layer Security Model: Protection from Infrastructure $\\rightarrow$ Model $\\rightarrow$ Application. 5 Security Pillars: Compliance, Privacy, Controls, Risk Management, Resilience. Hallucination Mitigation: Combining Prompt Engineering, RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), and Fine-tuning. RAG Workflow: Input $\\rightarrow$ Embedding $\\rightarrow$ Context $\\rightarrow$ LLM $\\rightarrow$ Output. Control Tools: Bedrock Guardrails, Human-in-the-loop, Observability (OpenTelemetry) to prevent risks according to OWASP LLM standards. 3.4. AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC) A new concept in software development lifecycle:\nEvolution: AI-Assisted $\\rightarrow$ AI-Driven $\\rightarrow$ AI-Managed. Stages: Inception $\\rightarrow$ Construction $\\rightarrow$ Operation. Implementation: Integrating Infrastructure as Code (IaC), automated testing, monitoring, and risk management directly into the process. 4. KEY TAKEAWAYS \u0026amp; NEW THINKING After the event, I synthesized important changes in thinking and strategy:\nSystem Design Thinking:\nMust design Data \u0026amp; AI systems in an End-to-end approach, firmly eliminating Data Silos. Apply Self-service and Governance principles from the early stages. Technical Architecture:\nLeverage the power of Zero-ETL and Lakehouse for sustainable, easily scalable system operations. Combine service pieces (S3, Glue, Bedrock\u0026hellip;) into a unified platform instead of disparate tools. Development Strategy:\nBusiness-first: All technology decisions must originate from business problems. Data and Security are the \u0026ldquo;Foundation\u0026rdquo; - without this foundation, AI cannot deliver value. Balance: Between innovation speed and cost/security. AI-DLC: Standardize development processes with AI participation at every stage (Code, Review, Test, Doc). 5. APPLICATION PLAN FOR WORK Based on learned knowledge, I propose specific application plans:\nIn Real Projects:\nPilot AI Agent for Login/Registration module and Customer Support (Chatbot). Integrate Validation/Guardrails to ensure GenAI input/output data safety. In Learning \u0026amp; Teamwork:\nApply AI-DLC model: Use AI to assist in writing boilerplate code and creating technical documentation; humans focus on Review and Approve. Clearly analyze when to use Serverless (Lambda) (for short tasks, events) and when to use Containers (ECS/Fargate) (for long-term, complex applications). In Personal Role:\nPractice documentation thinking and requirements gathering in a Business-first approach. Focus on building a solid Data Foundation before deploying complex AI models. 6. EVENT \u0026amp; WORKSHOP EXPERIENCE (Recording actual experience at the event)\nThe most memorable highlight was the \u0026ldquo;GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization\u0026rdquo; Workshop. This was a valuable opportunity to practice modernizing applications and databases:\nTechnical Experience: Hands-on designing end-to-end data pipelines and accessing latest tools like Amazon Bedrock, AgentCore. RAG Practice: Deep understanding of how to minimize Hallucination through coordinating Prompt Engineering and RAG workflow.

Executive Summary The EV Station-based Rental System is developed to provide an all-in-one platform for electric vehicle rental and charging management. It integrates real-time rental, payment, and charging station access through a unified cloud-native solution. The system features a React Native mobile app and a Spring Boot backend deployed on AWS ECS Fargate, with PostgreSQL (RDS) and Redis (ElastiCache) for data and caching. User authentication is managed via Amazon Cognito, and global delivery is optimized using CloudFront. Designed under the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the platform ensures scalability, high availability, and security while maintaining cost efficiency.\n2. Problem Statement What’s the Problem? Current electric vehicle (EV) rental services are fragmented, requiring users to switch between multiple apps to locate, book, and manage rentals at fixed points. This creates inconvenience, slow performance, and unreliable experiences — users often arrive at “unavailable” or “offline” rental points, leading to frustration and loss of trust.\nFor vehicle owners and operators, manual fleet management, booking coordination, and maintenance tracking result in operational inefficiencies and lost revenue. Currently, there is no unified, real-time platform connecting renters, vehicle owners, and rental point operators.\nThe Solution The EV Station-based Rental System consolidates EV rental and return at fixed points into a single, cloud-native platform. Built with React Native for mobile and Spring Boot for backend, the system delivers real-time booking, vehicle tracking, and payment integration.\nKey AWS services include ECS Fargate for compute, RDS PostgreSQL for data storage, ElastiCache for low-latency performance, API Gateway and Cognito for secure access, and CloudFront for global content delivery. The platform supports both fleet-based and peer-to-peer (P2P) vehicle registration, providing a centralized interface for users and operators to manage rentals efficiently, securely, and at scale.\nBenefits and Return on Investment The platform eliminates manual coordination and fragmented applications, offering a unified, automated experience for renters and fleet owners. Real-time data ensures reliability and transparency regarding vehicle availability and rental point status.\nDesigned under the AWS Well-Architected Framework, the system minimizes operational costs with a serverless, pay-per-use model while maintaining scalability and 99.99% uptime. Within 12–24 months, the platform is projected to reach 50,000+ monthly active users, onboard 200+ rental points, and deliver significant time, cost, and operational efficiencies for both users and operators.\n3. Solution Architecture The VoltGo platform adopts a serverless and fully private AWS architecture for secure and scalable backend operations. Backend run on Amazon ECS Fargate, connecting to Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2 for relational data and ElastiCache Serverless (Redis) for caching. All workloads are deployed in private subnets across multiple Availability Zones and accessed securely through API Gateway via AWS PrivateLink to an internal Network Load Balancer. User authentication is managed by Amazon Cognito, while the frontend is hosted on Amazon S3 and delivered globally via CloudFront, protected by AWS WAF and ACM SSL/TLS. Monitoring and secrets management are handled by CloudWatch and Secrets Manager, with the entire infrastructure provisioned through Terraform IaC. This architecture ensures high security, elasticity, and cost efficiency suitable for the current development stage and future production scaling.\nAWS Services Used Amazon ECS Fargate: Serverless container orchestration for backend microservices. Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL Serverless v2: Scalable, multi-AZ relational database. Amazon ElastiCache Serverless (Redis): In-memory caching for low-latency data access.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud.

ATTENDANCE OBJECTIVES Event participation focused on 4 core objectives to enhance technical capabilities and strategic thinking:\nShaping Mindset: Grasp the essence of the Value Cycle and DevOps mission in ensuring continuous and reliable software flow. Infrastructure Automation (IaC): End the era of manual operations (ClickOps), transition to infrastructure management through code with three key tools: CloudFormation, Terraform, and CDK. Containerization Strategy: Deep understanding of architecture and criteria for selecting optimal Container operating platforms: App Runner for simplicity, ECS for efficiency, or EKS for flexibility. Proactive Monitoring (Observability): Establish comprehensive \u0026ldquo;eyes and ears\u0026rdquo; system to detect incidents and optimize performance through CloudWatch and X-Ray. 2. SPEAKER LIST The event brought together top experts from AWS and Cloud Engineering:\nAWS Experts \u0026amp; Cloud Engineers Team – Engineers and solution architects sharing Platform Engineering models and hands-on technical demos. 3. TECHNICAL CONTENT HIGHLIGHTS 3.1. DevOps Mindset \u0026amp; CI/CD Pipeline (Foundation of Thinking) The event redefined DevOps not just as tools, but as a culture optimizing value flow:\nThe Value Cycle: A complete 5-stage cycle from Insights $\\rightarrow$ Portfolio $\\rightarrow$ CI $\\rightarrow$ Testing $\\rightarrow$ CD. The goal is balancing Release Speed and Stability. Clearly distinguish automation levels: Continuous Integration (CI): Daily code merges, automatic Build and Test to detect errors early (Fail fast). Continuous Delivery: Automatic deployment to Staging, but requires human approval (Manual Trigger) for Production. Continuous Deployment: 100% automation of flow from Commit to Production. Optimal Pipeline Strategy: Centralized CI: Build centralized CI for management but empower Self-service for Developers. Artifact Management: Follow the principle \u0026ldquo;Build Once, Deploy Anywhere\u0026rdquo;. Package source code only once (Artifact) and use it for all environments to ensure consistency. Fail Conditions: Pipeline must stop immediately if encountering compilation errors, code standard violations, security vulnerabilities, or slow tests. Metrics: Use Heatmap and DORA metrics (Deploy frequency, Failure rate, MTTR) to measure process health. 3.2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) - From ClickOps To Code Journey to eliminate risks from manual operations (ClickOps) towards Accuracy, Scalability, and Collaboration:\nAWS CloudFormation (Native): Use YAML/JSON to define resources. Manage lifecycle through Stack concept (deleting Stack cleans up resources). Terraform (Multi-Cloud): Open-source power with HCL language. Standard workflow: Write $\\rightarrow$ Plan (Preview changes) $\\rightarrow$ Apply. Strength is multi-platform management capability (AWS, Azure, GCP) and state management through State File. AWS CDK (Code-based): Define infrastructure using programming languages (Python, TypeScript\u0026hellip;). Constructs: From L1 (Detailed configuration) to L3 (Pre-built architecture Patterns). Drift Detection: Critical feature to detect configuration drift from manual edits, helping maintain system discipline. 3.3. Containerization - Application Running Strategy Analysis of Orchestration and Compute choices:\nComparing ECS vs. EKS: Amazon ECS: Simple, tightly integrated with AWS ecosystem, suitable for teams wanting fast deployment and reduced operations. Amazon EKS: Kubernetes standard, powerful and flexible, for complex Enterprise systems or Hybrid-cloud. Compute Models: EC2 Launch Type: Maximum control but requires server management effort. AWS Fargate: Serverless for containers, only need to care about CPU/RAM, AWS handles underlying infrastructure. AWS App Runner: \u0026ldquo;Zero-ops\u0026rdquo; solution, turn code/image into Web App with HTTPS in just a few steps, no network/server configuration needed. 3.4. Observability - Monitoring \u0026amp; Optimization Ensure deep and broad observability for stable operations:\nAmazon CloudWatch: Collect performance data (Metrics), centralized logs (Logs), and automatic response (Alarms) when system encounters issues. AWS X-Ray: Distributed Tracing tool, helps trace request journey through microservices to find Bottlenecks and root causes. Best Practices: Clearly distinguish roles of Logs (events) and Traces (journeys); use standard AWS Patterns to set up monitoring. 4. DETAILED EVENT EXPERIENCE This topic completely changed my perspective on system operations:\n4.1. Shift from \u0026ldquo;Ops\u0026rdquo; to \u0026ldquo;Platform Engineering\u0026rdquo; I realized modern DevOps is not about running after Developers to deploy for them. DevOps is about building \u0026ldquo;Highways\u0026rdquo; (Pipeline \u0026amp; Platform). A good platform is where Developers can self-serve infrastructure needs within the safe framework (Governance) that the DevOps team has established.\n4.2. Operational Discipline The principles of Artifact Management and Drift Detection are valuable lessons. In enterprise environments, Consistency is a critical factor. Absolutely do not rebuild code in different environments and strictly prohibit manual configuration changes when IaC has been applied.\n4.3. Smart Tool Selection Strategy There is no \u0026ldquo;best\u0026rdquo; tool, only the \u0026ldquo;most suitable\u0026rdquo; choice:\nNeed stability and native support: Choose CloudFormation. Multi-cloud enterprise: Terraform is mandatory. Team strong in programming, needs to reuse complex architecture: AWS CDK is the ultimate weapon. Simple Web App: Use App Runner instead of wasting resources operating Kubernetes. 5. CONCLUSION The \u0026ldquo;DevOps \u0026amp; IaC Mastery\u0026rdquo; topic painted a complete roadmap for Cloud modernization journey:\nAbout Mindset: Complete transition from manual to automation and data-driven measurement. About Infrastructure: Master IaC to ensure scalability, reproducibility, and configuration control. About Operations: The combination of flexible Containerization and deep Observability is the key to a high-performance and sustainable system. This is a solid knowledge foundation for me to confidently build and operate large-scale software systems on AWS.\n"},{"uri":"https://github.com/LeThiYenVi/AWS-Report.git/5-workshop/5.3-setup-bedrock/","title":"Setup AWS Bedrock","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Setting up AWS Bedrock \u0026amp;

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink.

ATTENDANCE OBJECTIVES This event series doesn\u0026rsquo;t just introduce tools, but aims to build solid System Thinking to transition from traditional infrastructure to Cloud-Native Security model. Core objectives include:\nCommunity Connection: Spread the learning spirit through AWS Cloud Clubs. Establishing Governance Foundation: Ensure compliance when operating large-scale systems with hundreds of AWS accounts. Defense in Depth: Eliminate single points of failure by closely coordinating Identity, Network, and Data Protection. Automated Response: Address human latency with automated incident handling processes. 2. SPEAKER LIST The event brought together experts from AWS Community, Cloud Engineers, and core members of the First Cloud Journey program:\nAWS Cloud Clubs Captains: Le Vu Xuan An (HCMUTE), Tran Duc Anh (SGU), Tran Doan Cong Ly (PTIT), Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi (HUFLIT) Identity \u0026amp; Governance: Huynh Hoang Long, Dinh Le Hoang Anh (AWS Community Builders) Detection \u0026amp; Monitoring: Tran Duc Anh, Nguyen Tuan Thinh, Nguyen Do Thanh Dat Network Security: Kha Van (Cloud Security Engineer | AWS Community Builder) Data Protection: Thinh Lam, Viet Nguyen Incident Response: Mendel Grabski (Long) - ex Head of Security \u0026amp; DevOps, Tinh Truong - Platform Engineer 3. TECHNICAL CONTENT HIGHLIGHTS 3.1. AWS Cloud Clubs \u0026amp; Development Opportunities Opening with introduction to AWS Cloud Clubs - the incubator for future Cloud talent:\nVision: Empower students to master cloud technology, develop leadership skills, and connect globally. Benefits: \u0026ldquo;Learning by doing\u0026rdquo; through real projects, receiving AWS exam vouchers, Udemy accounts, and career opportunities. The Badging Journey: Gamified advancement path through levels from Bronze to Diamond. Attractive rewards include AWS Credits ($200+), exam vouchers, and privileges at Student Community Day. 3.2. Identity And Governance Foundation Controlling \u0026ldquo;Who can do what\u0026rdquo; is the first step of security:\nModern IAM Mindset: Identity is the new firewall on Cloud. Absolute priority for Short-term Credentials (self-expiring STS tokens) instead of Long-term Credentials (risky Access Keys). Least Privilege Principle: Minimize use of wildcard * in Policies. Large-scale Governance: Use AWS Organizations to divide organization into isolated units (OUs). Apply Service Control Policies (SCPs) as a \u0026ldquo;constitution\u0026rdquo; to establish inviolable Guardrails, blocking dangerous actions at the root. 3.3. Visibility And Detection Capability Cannot protect what we cannot see:\nAmazon GuardDuty: \u0026ldquo;Scout\u0026rdquo; using Machine Learning to examine 3 data sources: CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS Logs. Runtime Monitoring feature allows deep OS visibility to catch unusual processes or privilege escalation behavior. AWS Security Hub: \u0026ldquo;Command center\u0026rdquo; helping standardize all alerts from multiple sources to common ASFF format. Simultaneously auto-assesses system compliance against international security standards (CIS, PCI-DSS). 3.4. Network Security Strategy for building multi-layered \u0026ldquo;Digital Fortress\u0026rdquo;:\nBasic Controls: Use Security Groups (Stateful) with Micro-segmentation technique (reference by group instead of hard IP). Combine NACLs (Stateless) for coarse blocking at Subnet boundaries. Advanced Defense: DNS Firewall: Block connections to hacker C2 servers right at domain resolution stage. AWS Network Firewall: Next-generation firewall with Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), combined with Stateful engine filters (Suricata compatible) to control Internet-bound traffic. Modern Architecture: Integrate AWS Transit Gateway to simplify routing and apply Active Threat Defense - automatically sync blacklists from GuardDuty to block threats instantly. 3.5. Data Protection Protect digital assets with intelligent encryption:\nEnvelope Encryption: Understand KMS mechanism: Master Key protects Data Key, and Data Key directly encrypts data. This ensures maximum performance and security. Secret Management: Instead of hardcoding passwords, use AWS Secrets Manager combined with Lambda for periodic Database password Automatic Rotation. Hardware Infrastructure: Leverage AWS Nitro System to push encryption tasks to dedicated chips, ensuring data protection without impacting server CPU performance. 3.6. Incident Response Response process determines damage level when defense fails:\nPrevention Strategy: \u0026ldquo;Prevention is better than cure\u0026rdquo; by eliminating SSH/long-term Keys, blocking Public S3. Mandate infrastructure management via Code (IaC) to avoid manual errors (ClickOps). 5-Step Process: Prepare $\\rightarrow$ Detect $\\rightarrow$ Isolate (change Security Group/revoke IAM permissions) $\\rightarrow$ Eradicate \u0026amp; Recover $\\rightarrow$ Post-incident (Lessons learned). Automation is key: Humans cannot be faster than machines. Need to use EventBridge + Lambda to automatically isolate infected resources or fix configuration errors in just seconds. 4. DETAILED EVENT EXPERIENCE This topic series completely changed how I view Cloud security:\n4.1. \u0026ldquo;Security by Design\u0026rdquo; Mindset The most important highlight is shifting from \u0026ldquo;Security is a wall\u0026rdquo; thinking to \u0026ldquo;Security is DNA\u0026rdquo;. Every service, every architecture must be designed with security from the start, not as a final patch layer.\n4.2. Power of Automation The automated Incident Response demo impressed me deeply. Using EventBridge combined with Lambda to react to abnormal events in seconds instead of waiting for human intervention is truly a major advancement in security operations.\n4.3. Community is the Key AWS Cloud Clubs is not just a place to learn technical skills but also an environment to develop soft skills, networking, and career opportunities. The Badging Journey has gamified the learning process, creating strong motivation for self-development.\n5. CONCLUSION The \u0026ldquo;Cloud Security \u0026amp; Operations Mastery\u0026rdquo; topic series painted a comprehensive roadmap to build secure systems on AWS:\nGovernance \u0026amp; Identity: Build solid foundation from organizational policies and user management. Network \u0026amp; Monitoring: Establish multi-layered defense system with deep and broad observability. Data \u0026amp; Response: Protect core assets with encryption and prepare automated response scenarios to ensure business continuity. This is important foundational knowledge for me to confidently deploy and operate Cloud systems with comprehensive security mindset.\n"},{"uri":"https://github.com/LeThiYenVi/AWS-Report.git/4-eventparticipated/","title":"Events Participated","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Throughout my internship at First Cloud Journey, I had the opportunity to participate in 4 significant technology events.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone. This section leverages the infrastructure deployed by CloudFormation in the Prepare the environment section.\nCreate DNS Alias Records for the Interface endpoint Navigate to the Route 53 management console (Hosted Zones section). The CloudFormation template you deployed in the Prepare the environment section created this Private Hosted Zone. Click on the name of the Private Hosted Zone, s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com: Create a new record in the Private Hosted Zone: Record name and record type keep default options Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor (you saved when doing section 4.3) Click Add another record, and add a second record using the following values. Click Create records when finished to create both records. Record name: *. Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"},{"uri":"https://github.com/LeThiYenVi/AWS-Report.git/1-worklog/1.4-week4/","title":"Week 4 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 4 Objectives: Dev Environment: Set up AWS Cloud9 as a unified development environment.

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier. Click the Policy tab. Click Edit policy. The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. { \u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"},{"uri":"https://github.com/LeThiYenVi/AWS-Report.git/1-worklog/1.5-week5/","title":"Week 5 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Week 5 Objectives: Fast VPS: Deploy a complete WordPress application in 5 minutes using Amazon Lightsail.

Working Environment\nThe environment at FCJ is very professional, dynamic, and technology-focused. What impressed me most is the \u0026ldquo;Open communication\u0026rdquo; culture – where all opinions are heard. The workspace stimulates creativity, especially with cloud infrastructure and resources always available for interns to experience. However, sometimes high project pressure creates a somewhat tense atmosphere. I think having additional short break-time activities would help everyone recharge better.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don\u0026rsquo;t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports procedures, documentation, and creates favorable conditions for me to work smoothly. I highly appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving answers.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe program helped me expand my comfort zone, from only knowing how to write frontend code to understanding how the frontend interacts with backend systems and cloud infrastructure. This is valuable supplementary knowledge that schools rarely have the opportunity to delve into deeply.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nBesides technical skills (React Native, AWS Services), I learned a lot about Agile/Scrum software development processes and professional source code management. Especially through code reviews and progress meetings, I realized the importance of communication and presentation skills – areas I am striving to improve daily.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but remains cheerful. The spirit of \u0026ldquo;Ownership\u0026rdquo; is highly valued. All members support each other wholeheartedly. Even when I made mistakes due to not following procedures, instead of criticism, everyone sat down together to help me find solutions. This made me feel accepted and motivated to change positively.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe rights regarding internship certification support are very clear. The biggest advantage is being provided an AWS account to practice freely without worrying about costs – an extremely practical benefit for technical people. Additionally, being able to participate in internal training sessions is a major plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship?\nIt was the opportunity to \u0026ldquo;do real work\u0026rdquo;. I was directly involved in building a complex product and saw my code running in reality on devices, not just limited to simulated exercises. What do you think the company should improve for future interns?\nI think the company should organize more in-depth soft skills workshops from the beginning of the term, especially on Time Management and Work Discipline. For new students like me, transitioning from an academic environment to a professional work environment sometimes causes \u0026ldquo;culture shock\u0026rdquo; regarding schedules and processes. If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not?\nDefinitely yes. This is an ideal environment to \u0026ldquo;push\u0026rdquo; yourself to mature. You will not only learn cutting-edge technology (Cloud, IoT) but also cultivate the serious work attitude of a true software engineer. Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?\nI suggest the program could establish \u0026ldquo;Check-point\u0026rdquo; milestones for discipline and attitude every 2 weeks (instead of only evaluating technical skills). Early feedback on work style will help interns adjust their behavior in time, avoiding procedural errors at the end of the term. Would you like to continue this program in the future?\nI very much hope to have the opportunity to continue working with FCJ or AWS in higher positions (such as Fresher or Junior) after overcoming my current weaknesses. Any other comments (free sharing):\nThank you FCJ for giving me a memorable journey. Although I still have many shortcomings to improve, the patience of my Mentor and Team has been the greatest motivation for me to persevere to the end.
