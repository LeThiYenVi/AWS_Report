# EVENT HARVEST REPORT
**Event:** AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1: Generative AI, RAG & AWS Agentic AI

---

## 1. ATTENDANCE OBJECTIVES
Event participation focused on 5 core objectives to enhance technical capabilities and strategic thinking:
* **Prompt Engineering:** Master Prompt Engineering techniques to optimize the ability to control language models.
* **AWS AI Services:** Explore the ecosystem of AWS Pretrained AI Services.
* **RAG Architecture:** Dive deep into building intelligent applications using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) techniques.
* **Agentic AI:** Update on Agentic AI trends and methods for transitioning AI Agents from Proof of Concept (POC) to Production through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore.
* **Voice AI Framework:** Approach Pipecat – Framework supporting real-time voice interactive virtual assistant development.

---

## 2. SPEAKER LIST

## 3. TECHNICAL CONTENT HIGHLIGHTS

### 3.1. Prompt Engineering & Foundation Models (Core Foundation)
Before approaching advanced services, the event emphasized the importance of effective communication with Foundation Models on Amazon Bedrock:
* **Zero-shot / Few-shot Prompting:** Techniques for direct commands or providing a few sample examples to guide desired output.
* **Chain of Thought (CoT):** Requiring the model to "reason step-by-step", enhancing accuracy when solving complex logic problems.

### 3.2. Pretrained AI Services (AWS AI Services)
Introduction to convenient API suite, allowing AI integration without the effort of model training:
* **Image/Video:** Amazon Rekognition.
* **Language:** Amazon Translate, Comprehend, Textract (OCR).
* **Audio:** Amazon Polly (Text-to-Speech), Transcribe (Speech-to-Text).

### 3.3. RAG - Retrieval Augmented Generation
Solution helping AI respond based on enterprise internal data, minimizing the risk of providing incorrect information:
* **Embeddings:** Applying Amazon Titan Text Embeddings V2 to vectorize data for semantic search.
* **Knowledge Bases for Amazon Bedrock:** Managing the entire process from data Chunking $\rightarrow$ Vector Storage $\rightarrow$ Retrieval $\rightarrow$ Answer Generation.

### 3.4. Evolution to Agentic AI (The Era of Task AI)
The evolution picture of GenAI:
* **GenAI Assistants:** Supporting automation of repetitive rule-based tasks.
* **GenAI Agents:** Goal-oriented, handling broader workflow chains.
* **Agentic AI Systems:** Multi-agent systems operating completely autonomously with minimal human intervention.
* **"The Prototype to Production Chasm" Challenge:** Bringing Agents to market faces major barriers in Performance, Security & Governance, and Complexity in context management/auditing.

### 3.5. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore: Solution for Bringing Agents to Market
AWS introduces AgentCore to solve Agent operations challenges:
* **Core Components:** Runtime & Memory (Execution environment & Memory), Identity & Gateway (Identity & Connection), Code Interpreter (Self-write and run code), Observability (Operations monitoring).
* **Benefits:** Helps developers focus on business logic instead of struggling with security infrastructure or context storage.

### 3.6. Pipecat: Framework for Real-time Voice AI
Introduction to open-source framework optimized for Multimodal virtual assistants:
* **Features:** Optimized for low latency (Real-time) and streaming processing.
* **Operating mechanism:** WebRTC Input (Receive audio) $\rightarrow$ STT (Convert to text) $\rightarrow$ LLM Processing $\rightarrow$ TTS (Convert to speech) $\rightarrow$ Output (Playback).

## 4. DETAILED EVENT EXPERIENCE

The workshop helped me expand my vision from foundational knowledge to pioneering technologies shaping the future of AI.

### 4.1. Shift from "Q&A" to "Action" (Agentic AI)
What impressed me most was the concept of Agentic AI. It changed my thinking about AI from just chat/summarization to the image of "virtual employees" capable of self-planning, using tools (web browsing, code writing) to solve problems without hand-holding.

### 4.2. Solving the "Production" Problem
I highly appreciate the sharing about the "Chasm" between POC and Production. Tools like Amazon Bedrock AgentCore truly are the solution to enterprise trust issues, thanks to the robust security mechanisms (Identity) and monitoring (Observability) that AWS provides.

### 4.3. Voice AI Potential with Pipecat
The Pipecat demo was truly interesting. The combination of WebRTC and AI to create smooth conversations with extremely low latency opens up huge application potential: from Virtual Call Centers, Interview Assistants to AI Language Teachers.

---

## 5. CONCLUSION

The workshop "Generative AI & Agentic AI on AWS" painted a comprehensive value picture:

* **Present:** We optimize data with RAG and Prompt Engineering.
* **Future:** The Agentic AI era is approaching, where Autonomous Agents will change how businesses operate.
* **Tools:** With the AWS ecosystem (Bedrock, AgentCore) and Frameworks (Pipecat, LangChain), technical barriers are gradually being removed, creating momentum for engineers to realize breakthrough ideas.
